# Weighing distant clusters with the most ancient light

In arxiv:2009.07772, we present a mass measurement for the high-redshift MaDCOWs galaxy cluster sample using CMB lensing inferred from ACT and Planck data. This repository contains code that produces the figures and numbers in the paper. These can be obtained by running the cells in the notebook `code/madcows_lensing.ipynb`.

The repository also contains the LaTeX and associated files for the manuscript.
